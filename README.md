# CoreML MNIST Classifier
This repository serves as a place for me to learn how to use CoreML to create a neural network that can classify handwritten numbers based on the MNIST dataset. The model itself will be built using Pytorch, then imported into CoreML. Inference will be done on an iPhone X.

## Goals
- To learn how to use CoreML
- To learn how to import Pytorch models into CoreML
- To learn how to create an app that is able to show a view of the camera and process it using CoreML to output a class
- To learn how to prune networks to be able to run quickly and efficiently on an iPhone.
